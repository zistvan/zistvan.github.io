<h1>Hyperledger Fabric Tutorial -- How to build applications on a blockchain?</h1>
<p>Tutorial offered as part of the <a href="https://chainreaction.es">chainrEaction 2020</a> hackathon.</p>

<h2>Preparation: Virtual Machine</h2>

<p>
We have prepared a VM for you to use during the tutorial about Fabric.
It can be downloaded from <a href="https://software.imdea.org/cloud/index.php/s/hrkGG8PO3qwRCYk">here (1)</a> (the password is "Madrid").
</p>

<p>
After downloading the image, make sure to adjust the number of CPUs and the size of its allocated memory to values compatible with your computer.
The password for the default user is "password". Fabric is installed in the home directory of the user.
</p>

<p>
If you want to explore the official tutorials, try your hand at this <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html">tutorial</a>. The same website will also explain how to install Fabric from scratch (the virtual machine has the dependencies already installed).
