      <h1>Hiring</h1>

      <p>I am looking for talented PhD candidates to work with me in the area of systems at the IMDEA Software Institute in Madrid.</p>

      <p>The topic of the research is addressing the increasing gap between data volumes and CPU performance in the datacenter, which limits our ability to solve complex problems. If we want to tackle future computational challenges, we must look beyond today's software and hardware architectures.  This challenge can be approached on two tracks and the choice will depend on the student's existing expertise and research goals: 
      <ul>
      <li>Exploring how large distributed systems (e.g., databases, blockchain, ML pipelines) can be re-designed to scale to unprecedented number of nodes and take advantage of the modern hardware features in the datacenter.</li>
      <li>Using specialization (e.g., FPGAs, SmartNICs) as a way of proposing changes to the existing architectures and increasing the efficiency of data-intensive applications in the datacenter.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>

      <h2>Who should apply?</h2>

      <p>Ideal candidates have earned (or are in their last year of) a Master's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering, with experience in a subset of the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Networking and distributed programming</li>
        <li>Data management systems</li>
        <li>Operating systems</li>
        <li>FPGA/ASIC development</li>
        <li>High performance computing</li>
        <li>Compilers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to apply?</h2>

      <p>
        If you are interested in the position, please apply on our on-line platform with the following information: 1) your CV (with names and email addresses of three references), 2) an overview of your research interests and a concise summary of your Master's thesis or a project you contributed to (3 pages at most, uploaded as "Research Statement"). 

        </p>
        <p>
        To submit, choose <b>5 - PhD Student</b> and enter reference code <b>2019-07-phd-systems</b> on our IMDEA <a href="https://careers.software.imdea.org/">Careers website</a> before <b>15th of September 2019</b>. Only applications submitted with the correct reference code will be considered.

        </p>
